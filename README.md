- CMake (version 3.17.0 minimum)

1. Clone repo to desired local folder
2. Run this command: 

    `pip3 install cmake`

3. Navigate to the project root (Should have a CMakeLists.txt file in it)
4. `cmake . .`
5. `cmake build .`
6. An executable should now be available in your "out" directory
7. If you are not on Windows or CMake does not use Visual Studio to compile, you may simply have a Makefile in
